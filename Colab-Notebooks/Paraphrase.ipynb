        "  T5 (*Text-to-text Transfer Transformer*) is yet another transformer model for Google Research Group. This is a vanilla transformer i.e this model has both the encoder and decoder layers as described in the paper [ Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). T5 is a encoder-decoder model that reaches SOTA results by solving NLP problems with a text-to-text approach. This is where text is used as both an input and an output for solving all types of tasks. This was introduced in the recent paper, Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683)).\n",
